# **What, How, New York Drives? ðŸš—ðŸ“Š**

### **Project Overview**
This project analyzes **New York State's transportation dynamics** using **8.8 million vehicle transaction records**, **3.26 million crash records**, and **EV charging station data**. The goal is to understand **vehicle trends**, **road safety dynamics**, and **electric vehicle (EV) adoption**. The project utilizes **Tableau dashboards** to provide interactive visualizations for policymakers, transportation agencies, and the public.

## **Dataset Description**
The project utilizes **three primary datasets** from the **New York State Department of Motor Vehicles (NY DMV) and public data sources**:

1. **What New York Drives**
   - **Vehicle registrations and transactions data** (2023) from NY DMV.
   - Includes **8.8 million records** detailing **popular brands, vehicle body types, and registration trends**.
   - [Dataset Link](https://data.ny.gov/Transportation/Department-of-Motor-Vehicles-Registration-Transact/s2dd-yksa/about_data)

2. **How New York Drives**
   - **Motor vehicle crash data** (2018-2022).
   - Includes **3.26 million crash records**, covering **crash patterns, driver age groups, vehicle categories, and safety outcomes**.
   - [Dataset Link](https://data.ny.gov/Transportation/Motor-Vehicle-Crashes-Vehicle-Information-Three-Ye/xe9x-a24f/about_data)

3. **EV Adoption in New York**
   - **Electric vehicle (EV) charging station data** across New York.
   - Explores **EV infrastructure trends and adoption across different regions**.

## **Data Preprocessing**
To ensure high-quality input for analysis, the following preprocessing steps were applied:

1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Removed **irrelevant columns** and **filtered necessary records**.
   - Addressed **missing values** using **imputation techniques**.

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Categorized vehicle types, fuel types, and registration trends.
   - Mapped **crash severity, vehicle age, and safety trends**.
   - Identified **EV adoption growth by region**.

3. **Data Integration**
   - Merged datasets to enable **comparative analysis**.
   - Created **geospatial mappings** for transaction and crash densities.

- Identifies **popular vehicle brands (Toyota, Honda, Chevrolet)**.
- Examines **fuel types, body types, and vehicle age trends**.
- Visualizes **transaction densities across ZIP codes**.

### **2. How New York Drives? ðŸš¦**
- **Analyzes 3.26 million crash records (2018-2022)**.
- Examines **crash severity, driver demographics, and safety trends**.
- Highlights **crash hotspots and temporal trends (time of day, day of the week)**.
- Provides **insights into risk factors for different driver age groups**.

### **3. EV Adoption in New York ðŸ”‹âš¡**
- **Explores electric vehicle growth and charging infrastructure**.
- Maps **EV charging stations by city and county**.
- Identifies **popular EV brands and regions leading adoption**.
